# Welcome to Inotiv

This is the official GitHub organization for **Inotiv**.

## About Our Repositories

Our development work primarily takes place in **private repositories** to protect proprietary code and maintain the security of our internal tools and systems. While we don't currently maintain public open source projects, we may occasionally publish tools, libraries, or documentation that benefit the broader community.

## For External Visitors

We are not currently accepting public contributions or external pull requests. For business inquiries or questions, please:

- Visit our website: [inotiv.com](https://inotiv.com)
- Contact us through official channels

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in any public-facing Inotiv system or repository, please report it responsibly to [cybersecurity@inotiv.com](cybersecurity@inotiv.com). Do not open public issues for security concerns.

## For Team Members

1. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account
2. Complete SSO authentication if prompted
3. Contact your manager or the platform team for access
